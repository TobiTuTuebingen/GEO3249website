    "text": "Rockfalls, Landslides, Glacial lake outburst floods, debris flows and many more geomorphic hazards put human lives and settlements in danger. Switzerland is a densely populated country with many mountaineous areas in the Alps. Climate Change heavily influences alpine environments, especcially the cryosphere. Therefore the hole geomorphodynamic of the alps is changing rapidly, which brings new challenges for both adaption and mitigation strategies.\nSpeaking about hazards, the hazard itself, like debris flows and landslides must be understood, in terms of their triggering processes and their propagation mechanisms. Building on that the impact of the modelled climate change can be estimated, which will then helps to identify, which strategies can be choosen to cope with those hazards. Further information and data is accessible on the following webpages: Em-Dat Database. Information regarding policy and mitigation strategies can be found on: UNDRR PreventionWeb."

    "text": "Debris flows\nA debris flow can be defined as a rapid moving mass within a streambed, that consists of water, fine sediment and boulders, air and organic material (Zepp et al. 2023; Naqvi et al. 2023). Commonly the concentration of sediment reaches 30% to 60% (Moser, M. et al.). Debris flows occur periodically and are are a consequence of many contributing factors, such as topography, steep relief the availability of mobilisable debris and large amounts of water, such as high intensity precipitation event or meltwater from glaciers, snow or permafrost (Zepp et al. 2023)."

    "section": "Rockfalls and Rock avalanches",
    "text": "Rockfalls and Rock avalanches\nA rockfall is a vertical rapid movement of bedrock as a consequence of weathering processes in consolidated bedrock. Mostly diurnal cycles of temperature and insulation causes rockfalls. Important factors contributing to their genesis are local geology, topography, aspect, steepnees and altitude of the slope (Zepp 2023). Rock avalanches are of much greater velocities and due reach further in their movement. Large-scale rockfalls and rockslides are a direct consequence of weathering and occur mostly in high-mountain regions (Grotzinger and Jordan 2014)."

    "text": "Engineering Solutions\nTechnical solutions are mostly used for monitoring, modelling and risk estimation of natural hazards. Many techniques are used from ground based RADAR sensing, satellite remote sensing, LiDAR, Air borne optical and LiDAR measurement, to borehole measurements of temperatures in permafrost areas and field campaigns (Camera 2023; Noetzli 2024; Seiz 2011; Gischig 2010, BAFU 2020).\nAs Switzerland does not operate optical satellites itself, it is cooperating with the ESA and seeks to deepen this cooperation, to use satellite imagery (Camera 2023). Worldwide exceptional is the PERMOS network, consisting of 14 boreholes in the swiss alps, it is reporting permafrost temperatures since 25 years and helps to ground truth modelling and remote sensing data (Noetzli et al. 2021; Seiz 2911; PERMOS 2025)."

    "text": "Organisational Solutions\nAs a federal state, Switzerland is based on subsidence, so therefore mostly local authorities are in charge of natural hazard management. Cantons and the federal state, only step in, when necessary. In terms of spatial planning, knowledge about hazard prone areas are mandatory to be used and can stop further develop.\nLearning from each other and sharing data is right at the core of the Swiss strategy. Therefore multiple platforms, such as the public available and easy to understand Natural Hazards portal or the GIN-portal with live data for specialists exist. To further enhance knowledge transfer among stakeholders, the PLANAT community institutionally provides a platform for universities, engineering companies, reinsurance companies, different local, cantonal and federal authorities to exchange their knowledge."

    "text": "The Case for Bondo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of Bondo the geological weakness of the rock was well known in beforehand of the events. Back in 2012 smaller events of rockfalls at Piz Cengalo have occured and caused damage at the touristic infrastructure. In reaction to that events construction measurements, such as a collection basin and a in situ alarm system for debris flows and rockfalls were installed. In both measurements, the local population was politically involved. The picture left shows different optical and RADAR early warning systems as well as sirens and warning lights in the Bondo village. Although still significant damage was caused through the debris flows, the mitigation measurements have benn proven capable of preventing further damage. In comparison to the vast amount of sediment, aprroximately 550 000 m^3 of sediment, only few damage occured (Gabbi 2019 et al.; Walter et al. 2020).\n\n\n\n{width = 100%}"
