In densely populated Switzerland, these hazards are especially relevant. Climate change is transforming the Alpine cryosphere at high speed, reshaping geomorphic processes and creating new challenges for hazard management. Further information and data is accessible on the following webpages: [Em-Dat Database](https://public.emdat.be/data) and [UNDRR PreventionWeb](https://www.preventionweb.net/community/community-announcement).\n\n# Case Study: Bondo {#case-studies}\n\n<figure style=\"width:70%\">\n  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\"\n          src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bbf0dhwgWKc\"\n          frameborder=\"0\"\n          allowfullscreen>\n  </iframe>\n  <figcaption>Fig. 1: Event of Bondo 2025.

Despite huge year-to-year variability in casualties, since 1946 Switzerland has seen a decline in casualties from gravitational natural hazards. Between the 1960s and the 2010s the averaged yearly casualties have fallen from around 5 to 3 to 4. Especially the number of casualties as a consequence of flooding decreased significantly. Considering both a significant increase in rockfall activity (PERMOS 2025, view below) and in population, the decline in casualties is a huge success for natural hazard management in Switzerland. The overall number of casualties of 667 since 1946 is quite low in Switzerland.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nConsidering rockfall frequency, volume and permafrost involvement, we can clearly see the impact of global warming. Besides overall huge variability between single years, in the last decades both the volume and number of rockfalls have significantly increased. The number of rockfalls, caused by permafrost degradation has risen as well, which shows the effect of climate change (Brunner et al. 2024; Moser et al. 2025; Mani 2021). Uncertainties are largely due to the long history of observations. While in the pre satellite area before 1972, before Landsat, especially smaller rockfalls in remote areas, where not observed (Heipke 2017). \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Hazards {#hazards}\n\nIn high mountain areas, such as the swiss alps, many processes are temporarily and spatially linked. Therefore cascading processes are important and need to be considered.  Multi-hazard landscape approaches help us to understand, how spatial and temporal proximity of single events contribute to process chains, that can trigger further events and damage (Main 2021; Zepp et al. 2023).\n\n| | |\n|:---:|:---:|\n| <img src=\"bondomap.png\" width=\"100%\"><br> Fig. 4: Site of the Bondo event. | The 2017 Bondo event illustrates process chains.  In August 23 a rock avalanche of about 3 Mio m³ detached from a permafrost-degraded slope at Piz Cengalo (Fig. 4). When the debris hit a water-saturated sediment beneath a melting glacier it transformed into multiple debris flows, which reached Bondo and caused human causalties as well as severe damage to infrastructure (Walter et al. 2019; Mani 2021). |\n\n## Debris flows\n\nA debris flow can be defined as a rapid moving mass within a streambed, that consists of water, fine sediment and boulders, air and organic material (Zepp et al. 2023; Naqvi et al. 2023). Commonly the concentration of sediment reaches 30% to 60% (Moser, M. et al.). Debris flows occur periodically and are are a consequence of many contributing factors, such as topography, steep relief the availability of mobilisable debris and large amounts of water, such as high intensity precipitation event or meltwater from glaciers, snow or permafrost (Zepp et al. 2023). \n\n## Rockfalls and Rock avalanches\n\nA rockfall is a vertical rapid movement of bedrock as a consequence of weathering processes in consolidated bedrock. Mostly diurnal cycles of temperature and insulation causes rockfalls. Important factors contributing to their genesis are local geology, topography, aspect, steepnees and altitude of the slope (Zepp 2023). Rock avalanches are of much greater velocities and due reach further in their movement. Large-scale rockfalls and rockslides are a direct consequence of weathering and occur mostly in high-mountain regions (Grotzinger and Jordan 2014).\n\n\n# Climate Change {#climate-change}\nSince the 19th century the climate of the european alps is changing dramatical. Mean annual temperature increased by around 2 °C celsius and is expected to increase further (Fig. 3).  Depending on the scenario the european alps will see an increase in mean annual temperature in the scale between 3 °C and 6 °C which outpaces average global warming (Dumont et al. 2025).\n\n![Fig. 5: Change in temperature since 1940.

Frequency, location and magnitude of hazards in the rapid changing alpine environment are extremely sensitive to climate change (Mani 2021).

Permafrost can be defined as a multi-year frozen ground, that exists both in bedrock and sediment. Due to cohesive forces of the ice and its surrounding rock, permafrost acts like a clue, that keeps even the steepest slops and many otherwise unconsolidated sediments together. Without permafrost many slopes become unstable. Due to climate change, permafrost might be gone beneath altitudes of 3850m till 2100 under continued emission growth (Dumont et al. 2025).\"\n    },\n    muren: {\n      title: \"Debris flows\",\n      text: \"Debris flows are hyperconcentrated mixtures of water, air, and typically up to about 60% fine sediment (Qie 2023).

Regions with abundant sediment and rapid permafrost degradation will see the strongest rise in events, whereas catchments with limited sediment supply are unlikely to show significant trends (Moser 2025; Brunner 2024).\"\n    }\n  };\n\n  document.getElementById('dialog-title').textContent = texts[type].title;\n  document.getElementById('dialog-text').textContent = texts[type].text;\n  document.getElementById('dialog-container').style.display = 'block';\n}\n</script>\n\nThe effects of climate change on gravitational hazards differ temporally, regionally and from hazard to hazard. Although climate change affects the whole globe, its local effects depend highly on in-situ conditions, such as geomorphological, topographical, geological factors (Moser et al. 2025). \n\n# Mitigation and Adaption {#mitigation}\nAs a country with one of worlds highest GDPs and living standards, a long experience in the management of natural hazards, Switzerland is overall well prepared for the future. \n\nTechnical solutions play a central role in monitoring, modelling and assessing natural hazard risks. Methods range from ground-based-radar, airborne optical and LiDAR surveys to borehole temperature measurements and field campaigns (Camera 2023; Noetzli 2024; Seiz 2011; Gischig 2010; BAFU 2020).\n\nAs Switzerland operates no optical satellites itself, it closely cooperates with ESA (Camera 2023). Globally unique is the PERMOS network, which has monitored permafrost in boreholes since 25 years and provides essential data for risk assesment (Noetzli et al. 2021; Seiz 2911; PERMOS 2025).\n\nAs a federal state, Switzerland is based on subsidence, so mostly local authorities are in charge of natural hazard management. Cantons and the federal state, only step in, when necessary. In spatial planning, hazard risk maps are mandatory and determine further development. To enhance knowledge transfer multiple platforms, such as the public available and easy to understand [Natural Hazards portal](https://www.natural-hazards.ch) or the [GIN-portal](https://www.info.gin.admin.ch/en) with live data for specialists exist and make sure that all important stakeholders transfer there knowledge regularly.  \n\n## The Case for Bondo\n\n| | |\n|:---:|:---:|\n| <img src=\"alarmsystemcengalo.png\" width=\"100%\"><br> Fig. 7: Alarm system in Bondo. | Early warning systems were installed in Bondo after smaller rockfall events at Piz Cengalo in 2012 had already damaged tourist infrastructure.  In response, a sediment retention basin and an on-site alarm system for debris flows and rockfalls were constructed, with active involvement of the local population. The image on the left shows optical and radar-based monitoring systems as well as sirens and warning lights in the village. Although the 2017 debris flows still caused significant impacts, these mitigation measures effectively reduced further losses. Considering the large sediment volume involved actual damage remained comparatively limited (Gabbi et al. 2019; Walter et al. 2020) |\n\n# References\n\n## Figures and Pictures:\n* Fig. 1: Event of Bondo 2107.
