Switzerland is a densely populated country with many mountaineous areas in the Alps. Climate Change heavily influences alpine environments, especcially the cryosphere. Therefore the hole geomorphodynamic of the alps is changing rapidly, which brings new challenges for both adaption and mitigation strategies. \n\nSpeaking about hazards, the hazard itself, like debris flows and landslides must be understood, in terms of their triggering processes and their propagation mechanisms. Building on that the impact of the modelled climate change can be estimated, which will then helps to identify, which strategies can be choosen to cope with those hazards. Further information and data is accessible on the following webpages: [Em-Dat Database](https://public.emdat.be/data). Information regarding policy and mitigation strategies can be found on: [UNDRR PreventionWeb](https://www.preventionweb.net/community/community-announcement).\n\n# Case Studies {#case-studies}\n\n## Blatten\n\n![Fig. 1: Landslide of Blatten 2025.

Since 1946 the yearly causalties are reported on national level. \n\n\n\n\nAlthough there is a huge variability in the number of yearly causalties, since 1946 a overall decline can be observed. While in the 1960s on average 5 people per year died due to gravitational natural hazards \nIn comparison to for example Typhoons, tsunamis, earthquakes or volcanism in other countries and regions of the world, the overall number of causalties with 667 since 1946 is quite low in Switzerland. \n\nSwitzerland is a safe country and is capable of reducing the number of deaths due to gravitational hazards since 1946. Considering both a significant increase in rockfall activity (PERMOS 2025) and in population, the decline in causalties is a huge success for natural hazard management in Switzerland. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nConsidering rockfall frequency, volume and permafrost involvement, we can clearly see the impact of the global warming. Besides overall huge variability between single years, in the last decades both the volume and number of rockfalls have significantly increased. The number of rockfalls, caused by permafrost degradation, rised as well, which shows the effect of climate change.\n\nUncertainties are largely due to the long history of observations. While in the pre Satellite area before 1972, with the merge of Landsat, especcially smaller rockfalls in remote areas, where not observed or reported (Heipke 2017). \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# Hazards {#hazards}\n\n## Debris flows\n\nConsisting of \n\n## Rockfalls\n\nA rockfall is vertical rapid movement of bedrock as a consequence of weathering processes in consolidated rockwalls. Mostly diurnal cycles of temperature and insulation causes rockfalls. Important factors contributing to their genesis are local geology, topography, aspect, steepnees and altitude of the slope (Zepp 2023).\n\n\n## Landslides\n\n\n\n# Climate Change {#climate-change}\nSince the 19th century the climate of the european alps is changing dramatical. Mean annual temperature increased by around 2 °C celsius and is expected to increase further (Fig. 3).  Depending on the scenario the european alps will see an increase in mean annual temperature in the scale between 3 °C and 6 °C (Dumont et al. 2025).\n\n![Fig. 3: Change in temperature since 1940. European Alps are outpacing global average by far.

That has multiple effects, especially on the cryosphere and hydrosphere. Frequency, location and magnitude of hazards in the rapid changing alpine environment are extremely sensitive to climate change (Mani 2021).

Permafrost thaw, decreased sediment cohesion and the increase in high intensity precipitation events contribute to growing frequencies and magnitude of debris flows in the future (Dumont et al. 2025). Especially regions with current permafrost degradation and unlimited sediment supply will experience a significant increase of debris flows (Moser 2025). In catchments with limited sediment supply, no significant change can be determined, although rainfall intensities increase (Brunner 2024).\"\n    }\n  };\n\n  document.getElementById('dialog-title').textContent = texts[type].title;\n  document.getElementById('dialog-text').textContent = texts[type].text;\n  document.getElementById('dialog-container').style.display = 'block';\n}\n</script>\n\n# Mitigation and Adaption {#mitigation}\nAs a country with one of worlds highest GDPs and living standards, a long experience in the management of natural hazards, Switzerland is overall well equited for the future. \n\n## Engineering Solutions\n\nTechnical solutions are mostly used for monitoring, modelling and risk estimation of natural hazards. Many techniques are used from ground based RADAR sensing, satellite remote sensing, LiDAR, Air borne optical and LiDAR measrument, to borehole measurments of temperatures in permafrost areas and field campaigns (Camera 2023; Noetzli 2024; Seiz 2011; Gischig 2010, BAFU 2020). \n\nAs Switzerland does not operate optical satellites itself, it is cooperating with the ESA and seeks to deepen this cooperation, to use satellite imagery (Camera 2023). Worldwide exceptional is the PERMOS network, consisting of 14 boreholes in the swiss alps, it is reporting permafrost temperatures since 25 years and helps to ground truth modelling and remote sensing data (Noetzli et al. 2021; Seiz 2911; PERMOS 2025).\n\n## Organisational Solutions\n\nAs a federal state, Switzerland is based on subsidence, so therefore mostly local authorities are in charge of natural hazard management. Cantons and the federal state, only step in, when necessary. In terms of spatial planning, knowledge about hazard prone areas are mandatory to be used and can stop further develop.  \n\nLearning from each other and sharing data is right at the core of the Swiss strategy. Therefore multiple platforms, such as the public available and easy to understand [Natural Hazards portal](https://www.natural-hazards.ch) or the [GIN-portal](https://www.info.gin.admin.ch/en) with live data for specialists , exist. To further enhance knowledge transfer among stakeholders, the PLANAT community instituionally provides a platform for universities, engineering companies, reinsurance companies, different local, cantonal and federal authorities to exchange their knowledge. \n\n![Bondo](https://www.gr.ch/DE/institutionen/verwaltung/diem/awn/aktuelles/PresseDownloads/2017_10_27__O3A9902.jpg) Fig. X Rebuilding and Reparation after the Bondo Landslide of 2017. \n\n\n# References\n\n## Figures and Pictures:\n* Fig. 1: SRF, 2025.
