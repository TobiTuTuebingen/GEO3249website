# Welcome

Rockfalls, Landslides, Glacial lake outburst floods, debris flows and many more geomorphic hazards put human lives in danger. Switzerland is a densely populated country with many mountaineous areas in the Alps. Climate Change heavily influences alpine environments, especially the cryosphere. Therefore the hole geomorphodynamic of the alps is changing rapidly, which brings new challenges. Further information and data is accessible on the following webpages: [Em-Dat Database](https://public.emdat.be/data) and [UNDRR PreventionWeb](https://www.preventionweb.net/community/community-announcement).

# Damage {#damage}

Natural hazards caused damage ever since humans settled in the alps, as the Goldau rockslide from 1806 impressively shows, when a whole village was covered in debris and over 450 people died (Reynard 2025). Since 1946 the yearly casualties are reported on national level. 

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)


natdata <- readr::read_csv("envidatswiss.csv")
totcaus <- sum(natdata$total, na.rm = TRUE)
natdata_long <- natdata %>%
  mutate(across(c(flood, `debris flow`, landslide, rockfall), 
                ~ replace_na(., 0))) %>%
  mutate(Total_Yearly_Casualties = flood + `debris flow` + landslide + rockfall) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(`flood`, `debris flow`, `landslide`, `rockfall`),
    names_to = "Hazard type",
    values_to = "Number of Causalties"
  )
```

Although there is a huge variability in the number of yearly casualties, since 1946 a overall decline can be observed. While in the 1960s on average 5 people per year died due to gravitational natural hazards, in the 2010s that number has fallen to approximately 3 to 4 people per year. Especially the number of casualties as a consequence of flooding decreased significantly. In comparison to for example typhoons, tsunamis, earthquakes or volcanism in other regions of the world, the overall number of casualties of `r totcaus` since 1946 is quite low in Switzerland. 

Switzerland is a safe country and is capable of reducing the number of deaths due to gravitational hazards since 1946. Considering both a significant increase in rockfall activity (PERMOS 2025, view below) and in population, the decline in casualties is a huge success for natural hazard management in Switzerland.  

```{r plot1, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}

ggplot(natdata_long, aes(x = year, y = `Number of Causalties`, fill = `Hazard type`))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack")+
  labs(
    title = "Total number of causalties of gravitational hazards in Switzerland decreases",
    caption = "Fig. 2: Ploting by Tobias Tuchel. Data: Envidat 2025. Last accessed on 25/11/2025",
  )+
  geom_smooth(
    data = natdata_long, 
    aes(x = year, y = Total_Yearly_Casualties),
    inherit.aes = FALSE, 
    method = "loess",
    se = FALSE,
    colour = "black",
    linewidth = 1
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Considering rockfall frequency, volume and permafrost involvement, we can clearly see the impact of global warming. Besides overall huge variability between single years, in the last decades both the volume and number of rockfalls have significantly increased. The number of rockfalls, caused by permafrost degradation has risen as well, which shows the effect of climate change (Brunner et al. 2024; Moser et al. 2025; Mani 2021). Uncertainties are largely due to the long history of observations. While in the pre satellite area before 1972, before Landsat, especially smaller rockfalls in remote areas, where not observed (Heipke 2017). 

```{r plot2, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}

rockfall <- readr::read_csv("RockFallData_SLF.csv")

rockfall_yearly <- rockfall %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(count = n(),
            volumeyear = sum(volume, na.rm = TRUE))
  
# 2. Skalierungsfaktor definieren
scale_factor <- 1e-6   # Volumen in Millionen m³

rockfall <- rockfall %>%
  left_join(rockfall_yearly, by = "year")

ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = rockfall_yearly, 
            aes(x = year, y = count), color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(data = rockfall_yearly, 
              aes(x = year, y= count),
              se = FALSE,
              color = "orange")+
  geom_jitter(data = rockfall,
             aes(x = year, 
                 y = 22,               
                 color = permafrost),
             alpha = 0.5,
             size = 3,
             height = 0.9) +
  labs(
    title = "Rockfall frequency, volume and permafrost",
    x = "Year",
    caption = "Fig. 3: Ploting by Tobias Tuchel. Data from: Permos 2025."
  ) +
  geom_col(data = rockfall_yearly,

# Hazards {#hazards}

In high mountain areas, such as the swiss alps, many processes are temporarily and spatially linked. Therefore cascading processes are important and need to be considered.  Multi-hazard landscape approaches help us to understand, how spatial and temporal proximity of single events contribute to process chains, that can trigger further events and damage (Main 2021; Zepp et al. 2023).

| | |
|:---:|:---:|
| <img src="bondomap.png" width="100%"><br> Fig. 4: Site of the Bondo event. | The Bondo event of 2017 is a good example of cascading processes. In August 23th 2017 a rock avalanche occured at Piz Cengalo in the Canton of Grisons (Fig. 4). The event started as an rock-slope failure in a permafrost-degradation wall 3100 m asl. When 3 Million cubic meter of debris hit a melting glacier and its water saturated sediment, a debris flow was formed. Up to two days after the event, still new debris flows formed and flowed downwards towards Bondo. The event led to human casualties and significant damage on infrastructure (Walter et al. 2019; Mani 2021). Crucial for the propagation of the debris after the rock avalanche was the melting glacier and its debris beneath. Due to climate change the melting glacier released a lot of water, which was stored in the debris beneath (Walter et al. 2019; Mani 2021). |

## Debris flows

A debris flow can be defined as a rapid moving mass within a streambed, that consists of water, fine sediment and boulders, air and organic material (Zepp et al. 2023; Naqvi et al. 2023). Commonly the concentration of sediment reaches 30% to 60% (Moser, M. et al.). Debris flows occur periodically and are are a consequence of many contributing factors, such as topography, steep relief the availability of mobilisable debris and large amounts of water, such as high intensity precipitation event or meltwater from glaciers, snow or permafrost (Zepp et al. 2023). 

## Rockfalls and Rock avalanches

A rockfall is a vertical rapid movement of bedrock as a consequence of weathering processes in consolidated bedrock. Mostly diurnal cycles of temperature and insulation causes rockfalls. Important factors contributing to their genesis are local geology, topography, aspect, steepnees and altitude of the slope (Zepp 2023). Rock avalanches are of much greater velocities and due reach further in their movement. Large-scale rockfalls and rockslides are a direct consequence of weathering and occur mostly in high-mountain regions (Grotzinger and Jordan 2014).


# Climate Change {#climate-change}
Since the 19th century the climate of the european alps is changing dramatical. Mean annual temperature increased by around 2 °C celsius and is expected to increase further (Fig. 3).  Depending on the scenario the european alps will see an increase in mean annual temperature in the scale between 3 °C and 6 °C which outpaces average global warming (Dumont et al. 2025).

![Fig. 5: Change in temperature since 1940. European Alps are outpacing global average by far. Source: Dumont et al. 2025 ](Image 21-11-2025 at 15.14.jpg){fig-cap="Meine Bildunterschrift" width="70%"}

That has multiple effects, especially on the cryosphere and hydrosphere. Frequency, location and magnitude of hazards in the rapid changing alpine environment are extremely sensitive to climate change (Mani 2021). Click on the circles to find out more!

Due to cohesive forces of the ice and its surrounding rock, permafrost acts like a clue, that keeps even the steepest slops and many otherwise unconsolidated sediments together. Without permafrost many slopes become unstable. Due to climate change, permafrost might be gone beneath altitudes of 3850m till 2100 under continued emission growth (Dumont et al. 2025)."

Typically such events are triggered by high rainfall intensity. Permafrost thaw, decreased sediment cohesion and the increase in high intensity precipitation events contribute to growing frequencies and magnitude of debris flows in the future (Dumont et al. 2025). While regions with unlimited sediment supply and rapid permafrostdegradation will experience a significant increase of debris flows, catchments with limited sediment will not show siginificant trends (Moser 2025; Brunner 2024)."

The effects of climate change on gravitational hazards differ temporally, regionally and from hazard to hazard. Although climate change affects the whole globe, its local effects depend highly on in-situ conditions, such as geomorphological, topographical, geological factors (Moser et al. 2025). 

# Mitigation and Adaption {#mitigation}
As a country with one of worlds highest GDPs and living standards, a long experience in the management of natural hazards, Switzerland is overall well prepared for the future. 

## Engineering Solutions

Technical solutions are mostly used for monitoring, modelling and risk estimation of natural hazards. Many techniques are used from ground based RADAR sensing, satellite remote sensing, LiDAR, Air borne optical and LiDAR measurement, to borehole measurements of temperatures in permafrost areas and field campaigns (Camera 2023; Noetzli 2024; Seiz 2011; Gischig 2010, BAFU 2020). 

As Switzerland does not operate optical satellites itself, it is cooperating with the ESA and seeks to deepen this cooperation, to use satellite imagery (Camera 2023). Worldwide exceptional is the PERMOS network, consisting of 14 boreholes in the swiss alps, it is reporting permafrost temperatures since 25 years and helps to ground truth modelling and remote sensing data (Noetzli et al. 2021; Seiz 2911; PERMOS 2025).

## Organisational Solutions

As a federal state, Switzerland is based on subsidence, so therefore mostly local authorities are in charge of natural hazard management. Cantons and the federal state, only step in, when necessary. In terms of spatial planning, knowledge about hazard prone areas are mandatory to be used and can stop further develop.  

Learning from each other and sharing data is right at the core of the Swiss strategy. Therefore multiple platforms, such as the public available and easy to understand [Natural Hazards portal](https://www.natural-hazards.ch) or the [GIN-portal](https://www.info.gin.admin.ch/en) with live data for specialists exist. To further enhance knowledge transfer among stakeholders, the PLANAT community institutionally provides a platform for universities, engineering companies, reinsurance companies, different local, cantonal and federal authorities to exchange their knowledge. 

## The Case for Bondo

| <img src="alarmsystemcengalo.png" width="100%"><br> Fig. 7: Early warning systems installed after the 2012 events at Bondo. | In the case of Bondo the geological weakness of the rock was well known in beforehand of the events. Back in 2012 smaller events of rockfalls at Piz Cengalo have occured and caused damage at the touristic infrastructure. In reaction to that events construction measurements, such as a collection basin and a in situ alarm system for debris flows and rockfalls were installed. In both measurements, the local population was politically involved. The picture left shows different optical and RADAR early warning systems as well as sirens and warning lights in the Bondo village. Although still significant damage was caused through the debris flows, the mitigation measurements have benn proven capable of preventing further damage. In comparison to the vast amount of sediment, approximately 550 000 m\^3 of sediment, only few damage occured (Gabbi 2019 et al.; Walter et al. 2020). |
